# Try It!

The easiest way to quickly try out threatware is the following:

1. Make a copy of an existing threat model, and set share it so that anyone with the link can access it.
1. Locally run the container docker.io/threatwaretryit/api_threatware
1. Use the links at the top of your copied threat model to see the results of `convert` and `verify`

Tip: If using Chrome you may want to install a JSON viewer extension e.g. [JSON Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/json-viewer/gbmdgpbipfallnflgajpaliibnhdgobh).

1. Go through some of the comments in the threat model to see some of the features offered by threatware
